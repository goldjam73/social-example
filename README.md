# Social MEAN
Originally a simple twitter style web app built on the MEAN stack (Angular 1.2). 
Now in the process of converting to an Angular 1.5 component based app.


# @TODOS
* Convert top level app directive to component.
* Move top level nav bar into a component.
* Create sub components for repeated elements (potentially stateless).
* Create component and functionality for a registration page.
* Improve test coverage, especially end to end and Karma tests.


Initially based on examples from the book:

[Write Modern Web Apps with the MEAN Stack, By Jeff Dickey](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UEOZBAAAQBAJ&pg=PR2&lpg=PR2&dq=Dickey+Write+MEAN&source=bl&ots=YHCSKwjLtR&sig=Kq-ajpb1WfmEv2d0wAFv2f-Q6xo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiGhJ2h1cfRAhUHLcAKHUlTDDYQ6AEINjAF#v=onepage&q=Dickey%20Write%20MEAN&f=false)

to give me a chance to get some initial experience of the MEAN stack.
